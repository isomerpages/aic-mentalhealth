<p>REAL is a platform powered by Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), that’s
built to give your mental health the care it deserves. We recognise and
champion the reality of your feelings and emotions. You may have been taught

<p>REAL is trying to change this. We will never gaslight you. Your mental
health deserves care and help, not doubts and dismissals. If you feel it,
it’s real. It deserves real support.</p>
