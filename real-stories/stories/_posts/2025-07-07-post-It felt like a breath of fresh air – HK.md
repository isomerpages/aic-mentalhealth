<p><em>What keeps HK going? The ones she loves, and the quiet strength to look ahead to tomorrows.</em>
</p>
<p>“I didn’t struggle with mental health—or so it seemed.”, thought HK.</p>
<p>When HK began her university journey in 2022, the excitement quickly turned
into a whirlwind of responsibilities. Balancing her studies, a part-time
job, and her long-standing commitment to volunteering at a mental health
organization became overwhelming.</p>
<h3><strong>"I felt like I was juggling too many things at once, and I was about to drop them all," HK recalled, reflecting on those stressful days.</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike many who might ignore their struggles, HK recognised the importance
of seeking help. After years of volunteering as a peer supporter, she understood
that mental health was a crucial part of life. So, she took a courageous
step and reached out to SHINE Children and Youth Services, which focuses
on providing emotional support among young people.</p>
<p>"I knew I needed support, and I was fortunate to find it," HK shared.
Her case worker recommended counselling, which became a pivotal moment
for her.</p>
<h3><strong>"Having someone to talk to, someone who could help me process my emotions, was essential. It felt like a breath of fresh air."</strong></h3>
<p>Fast forward 1.5 years, and she still attend periodic counselling sessions.
"After each session, I leave feeling recharged, no matter how low I was
feeling before. It’s like hitting a reset button for my mind and spirit,"
HK explain, her eyes brightening with the memory of those uplifting moments.</p>
<p>Life hasn’t slowed down for HK though. With her increasing commitments,
including more volunteering and internships, burnout episodes still arise.
But HK learned to navigate them. "I see LS every 2-6 months, and it really
helps me to regain my momentum. Just having someone who can ask the right
questions at the right time can really make a difference."</p>
<h3><strong>Her journey highlights the importance of seeking help.</strong></h3>
<p>HK reflected, "I grew stronger to face my challenges. I’ve learned that
it’s okay to not be okay sometimes. It’s about how you pick yourself back
up and keep moving forward."</p>
<p>In a world where mental health is often overlooked, I encourage my peers
to acknowledge their struggles and seek the support they need. "Don’t wait
until it’s too late. There’s strength in asking for help, and it can truly
change your life."</p>
<p>With her focus on making a difference, she continues to volunteer, sharing
her story and supporting others on their mental health journeys. HK’s experience
serves as a reminder that while the path may be challenging, it’s also
filled with opportunities for growth and healing.</p>
<h3><strong>"Having good mental health helps me to look forward to the future instead of fixating on the past. What keeps me going is the people I love, and that matters to me a lot. "</strong></h3>
