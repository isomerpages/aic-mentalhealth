<p>Shannon's world began to crumble in 2016 with the death of her grandfather,
the one person who had always been her confidante and protector. His absence
left a void that felt insurmountable.</p>
<h3><strong>"I felt my world falling apart," she recalled, grappling with the profound loss.</strong></h3>
<p>The following year, tragedy struck again when Shannon became a victim
of sexual assault. This harrowing experience compounded her grief and left
her feeling isolated and vulnerable. As the years passed, she faced relentless
bullying at school, which only deepened her anxiety and despair.</p>
<h3><strong>"I was left all alone, with no one to turn to," she lamented, as the weight of her struggles became unbearable.</strong></h3>
<p>In a desperate attempt to escape the pain, Shannon made the difficult
decision to drop out of school. Instead of relief, it marked the saddest
point in her life. "I felt suicidal”, she shared, revealing the depths
of her despair. It was during this dark time that she found herself on
the verge of taking her own life.</p>
<p>Just when hope seemed lost, a lifeline appeared in the form of a call
from ZL, a case worker from the Community Mental Health team at Singapore
Association for Mental Health (SAMH).</p>
<h3><strong>"It was the first time that I truly felt listened to," Shannon expressed, her gratitude palpable. Without that call, she believes she might not be here today.</strong></h3>
<p>Shannon began attending regular counseling sessions with ZL, who not only
provided support but also invited her to community events organized by
YIT SAMH. These interactions became a source of strength and connection
for Shannon, helping her to engage meaningfully with others.</p>
<h3><strong>"The validation and support that I received from YIT SAMH has tremendously improved my life.”</strong></h3>
<p>Through counseling, Shannon learned to identify the symptoms of her anxiety
attacks and developed techniques to manage them.</p>
<p>Today, Shannon continues her journey of healing, embracing her identity
without shame. She shares her story in hopes of inspiring others who may
be struggling, reminding them that they are not alone and that help is
available. "If you feel it, it’s real. It’s okay to reach out, to seek
support. You don’t have to do it alone," she encourages, a beacon of hope
for those still lost in the darkness.</p>
