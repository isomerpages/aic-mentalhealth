<p><em>Everyone does self-care differently. For Amos, meditation is pretty much a must-do. This photo is taken outside the NUS therapy clinic where he sought help. Today he is doing his placemsent at the same clinic!</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amos grew up in what he calls a ‘fairly typical’ Singaporean household–with
just one tiny diﬀerence.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;“My elder brother was diagnosed with autism,” he explained.</strong></h3>
<p>In university, however, Amos was overwhelmed. It was one thing after another.
First, his grandmother took her own life. Then, a freak accident claimed
the life of a close family member. On top of his family turmoil, he was
also going through relationship problems, whilst being socially isolated
in the campus dorms.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Yet, despite these struggles, he tried his hardest to push through on
his own.
<br>
<br>“The reluctance to seek professional help came from thinking that it’s
not severe enough to warrant that. To think that I’m just weak, I need
to work harder, man up, buck up” he recalled.
<br>
<br>At his lowest point, Amos found himself in the hospital’s emergency department
after his mental health took a turn for the worse. Yet, even as Amos ‘didn’t
know how to keep (himself) safe anymore’, he continued to worry about how
the stigma surrounding mental illness might aﬀect him in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>“I didn’t have the words for it back then but, looking back, I think I was going through a depressive episode.”</strong></h3>
<p>In university, however, Amos was overwhelmed. It was one thing after another.

<h3><strong>“I thought my world was over, life was ruined even if I recovered, there would be a mark in my records, and I didn't know how it would aﬀect my career.”</strong></h3>
<p>It was not an overnight recovery. It wasn’t—by any standard—an easy process.
However, with the right medication, psychotherapy, and support from his
peers, he gained a clearer understanding of what he was going through and
what he could do to help himself.
<br>
<br>“It's having the vocabulary to articulate my thoughts. Being more open
and sharing what I'm experiencing, how I'm feeling. Putting words to emotions
and not being afraid to be vulnerable,” he recalled.
<br>
<br>Today, Amos supports others from the opposite side of the therapy room,
as he studies and trains to be a clinical psychologist. His lived experience
motivates and drives him to wake up every morning, to do the best for his
clients. However, his own journey with his mental health is not yet over.
He still has good days and bad days, but he has learned to manage them
with self-care routines and practices he finds helpful.
<br>
<br>Despite the setbacks, Amos came a long way. He shares his story of seeking
mental health support, in the hopes that others will embrace their own
experiences, learn and grow from it.</p>

<h3><strong>“The scientific evidence is clear that treatments will help. You are likely not the exception. Be open to trying&nbsp; it. Most importantly, you’re not alone, and you don’t have to do it alone.”</strong></h3>
