<h3><strong>Duration of Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The length of treatment varies from one person to another and is usually
dependent on the nature and severity of your mental health condition. Here
are some important things to consider when undergoing treatment:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Treatment length should be discussed with your therapist or doctor, but
it is often tentative and may be revisited during the course of treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is common for therapists to require a few rounds of assessment before
they can suggest a treatment plan for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to follow your healthcare professional’s recommended treatment
duration before deciding that a particular course of treatment isn’t working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment successfully ends when you have achieved the goals you’ve agreed
upon with your therapist or doctor.</p>
