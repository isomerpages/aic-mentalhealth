<p>There are many services within your community that can support you on
your mental health journey. Many social service agencies are fully funded
by the government and there is no out-of-pocket cost. These include the
Community Outreach Teams (CREST/CREST-Youth) and Community Intervention
Teams (COMIT)/Youth Integrated Teams (YIT). There are also GPs, Polyclinics,
and hospitals that provide mental health support.</p>

<h3><strong>Community Outreach Team (CREST/CREST-Youth)</strong></h3>
<p>CREST/CREST-Youth is the first-stop touchpoint that can advise you on
the kind of mental health support you need and provide emotional support.</p>
<p>You can contact a CREST provider directly to make an appointment, where
a&nbsp;trained professional will get to know you and identify your mental
health needs. After which, they will develop a personalised plan to guide
you on your mental health journey and connect you to additional support
like counselling or therapy.</p>
