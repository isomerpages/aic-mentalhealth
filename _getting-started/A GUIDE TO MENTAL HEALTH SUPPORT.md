<p>If you feel it, it’s real. No problem is too small and your feelings shouldn’t
be dismissed when it comes to your mental wellbeing. Even if you’re unsure
about the kind of support you need, a good place to start is to talk about
it. Know that help is always within reach.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>DON'T BOTTLE THINGS UP</strong></h3>
<p>Talk about your feelings with someone you trust – be it about your fears
or feelings of uncertainty, or even if it’s to just help them understand
how they can support your mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>If you prefer to share your feelings with others who might be experiencing
the same thing, you can reach out to anonymous online support groups like
Limitless’ Safehouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about the type of support you need, you can speak to
a social worker from your nearby Community Outreach Teams like CREST/CREST-Youth
who will advise you. You can also consult your General Practitioner (GP)
or polyclinic doctor about your struggles to receive an assessment and
possible treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING THINGS PRIVATE</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t be! Your visits to the doctor or a social service agency are confidential.
Your health records cannot be shared without your permission. The only
exception to this rule is when it’s ordered by a court of law, or if there’s
a need to prevent harm to yourself or to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
