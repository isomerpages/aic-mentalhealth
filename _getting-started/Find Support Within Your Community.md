<p>There are many services within your community that can support you on
your mental health journey. Many social service agencies provide support
that are fully funded by the government, while some may charge a nominal
fee. These include the Community Outreach Teams (CREST/CREST-Youth) and
Community Intervention Teams (COMIT)/Youth Integrated Teams. There are
also GPs, polyclinics, and hospitals that provide mental health support.</p>
