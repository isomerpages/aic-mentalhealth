<p>You may be worried about the cost of mental health treatment, but services
provided by social service agencies like CREST, CREST-Youth, COMIT, and
YIT are fully funded by the government and there is no out-of-pocket cost.</p>
<p>Consultation costs for medical services such as seeing a GP or Polyclinic
Doctor may vary between clinics, so you should approach the respective
GP or Polyclinic for more information on their fees. There are also financial
subsidies available that can help ease the burden.</p>

<h3><strong>Medisave</strong></h3>
<p>Mental health conditions like schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder,
and anxiety are covered by Medisave under the Chronic Disease Management
Programme (CDMP)-Mental Illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means you can use your Medisave to pay up to $500 of your outpatient
treatment cost per year. You’ll just have to co-pay 15% of your bill.</p>

<h3><strong>Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)</strong></h3>
<p>The Community Health Assist Scheme enables all Singapore Citizens to receive
subsidies for medical care at participating General Practitioner (GP) clinics.</p>
