<p>You may be worried about the cost for mental health treatment, but services
provided by social service agencies (CREST, CREST-Youth, COMIT, and YIT)
are fully funded by the government and are free of charge. Although some
agencies may charge a nominal commitment fee.</p>
<p>For medical services such as seeing a GP or Polyclinic Doctor, there are
financial subsidies that can help ease the burden.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Medisave</strong></h3>
<p>Mental health conditions like schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder,
and anxiety are covered by Medisave under the Chronic Disease Management
Programme (CDMP)-Mental Illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means you can use your Medisave to pay up to $500 of your outpatient
treatment cost per year. Youâ€™ll just have to co-pay 15% of your bill.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)</strong></h3>
<p>The Community Health Assist Scheme enables all Singapore Citizens to receive
subsidies for medical care at participating General Practitioner (GP) clinics.</p>
