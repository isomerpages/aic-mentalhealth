<p>Broadly, there are three types of mental health support that are available,
depending on your needs:</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Counselling</strong></h4>
<p>Helps you cope with issues and solve problems such as academic stress,
relationship issues, and major life changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Psychotherapy</p>
<p>Helps you understand and change unhelpful patterns of thought, feelings,
and behaviours to treat specific mental health conditions and disorders.</p>

like psychiatric medicine, rehabilitation, or emergency services might
